Notebook Tutorials on how to use nlpboost
=========================================

In `this folder <https://github.com/avacaondata/nlpboost/tree/main/notebooks>`_ you will find examples on how to use ``nlpboost`` in a tutorial format, with text explanations for each of the steps needed to configure the experiments. Notebooks can also be run in Google Colab.

The examples are very similar to those in `examples folder <https://github.com/avacaondata/nlpboost/tree/main/examples>`_\ , in the sense that the datasets chosen for each task are the same. However, in notebooks more models are trained for each dataset, and there are clear explanations on some key aspects of the configuration of each task that the raw scripts lack.
